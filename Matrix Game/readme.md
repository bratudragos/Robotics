Unstoppable Tank - throwback arcade game, fitting in the Shoot 'Em Up genre;
                   The player gets to control a tank and the goal is to advance through the levels. The tank is able to move
                   sideways and shoot through the cannon. To advance, you have to not get hit by incoming enemy bullets, 
                   either by shooting them or by dodging them.
                   Each level employs different difficulty levels,as the enemy bullets get wider, faster, and more resistant to
                   your cannon ammo.
                   The score increases everytime you dodge or shoot down an enemy bullet, the first granting more points.
                   With each level finished, the number of points that are awarded for your actions is increased too.
                   The player starts with one life only, meaning that if the tank gets hit once, the game is over. You can
                   increase your lives by shooting down the enemy bullets, every 10 kills awarding a new life.
